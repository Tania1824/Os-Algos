# OS Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of key **Operating System algorithms** using **C++**. These algorithms are fundamental to understanding how operating systems manage processes, memory, CPU scheduling, and resource allocation.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- **Process Scheduling**
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin

- **Page Replacement**
  - FIFO (First In First Out)
  - LRU (Least Recently Used)
  - Optimal Page Replacement

- **Deadlock Avoidance**
  - Banker's Algorithm

- **Memory Management**
  - First Fit
  - Best Fit
  - Worst Fit

- **Disk Scheduling**
  - FCFS
  - SCAN
  - C-SCAN
  - LOOK

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run any algorithm:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tania1824/Os-Algos.git
   cd Os-Algos
